# 🚀 ERC20 Token — Cyfrin Updraft Project

This repository contains an **ERC20 token smart contract**.

The goal of this project is to learn how to build, test, and deploy an ERC20 token using:
- Solidity
- OpenZeppelin
- Foundry (Forge + Cast + Anvil)

---

## Features

✅ ERC20 compliant token  
✅ Secure implementation using OpenZeppelin  
✅ Owner-only mint functionality  
✅ Anyone can transfer/approve tokens  
✅ Full test suite using Foundry  
✅ Deployment scripts for multiple networks  
✅ Supports verification on Etherscan / Block explorers
